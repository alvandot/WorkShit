- Indexed database columns for fast aggregations
- Caching opportunities (can be added to controller methods)
- Lazy loading of chart data
- Debounced API calls on filter changes

**Scalability:**
- Queries use date ranges to limit dataset size
- Pagination ready (can be added to list endpoints)
- API endpoints can be cached with Redis
- Chart data is aggregated on the backend

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Additions:**
1. **Drill-down Functionality** - Click charts to view detailed data
2. **Custom Report Builder** - Let users create custom reports
3. **Scheduled Reports** - Email reports on a schedule
4. **Dashboard Widgets** - Customizable widget layout
5. **More Export Formats** - PDF, Excel, CSV exports
6. **Advanced Filters** - Filter by engineer, company, priority, etc.
7. **Comparison Mode** - Compare multiple date ranges side-by-side
8. **Predictive Analytics** - ML-based forecasting
9. **Alerts & Notifications** - Set thresholds and receive alerts
10. **Heat Maps** - Visualize busy times and days

## Database Requirements

The analytics dashboard uses existing tables:
- `tickets` - Main ticket data
- `ticket_activities` - Activity logs
- `ticket_status_histories` - Status change tracking
- `users` - Engineer/user data
- `parts` - Parts usage data

**No additional migrations required** - The dashboard works with the existing schema.
